## Shortify – YouTube Shorts Generator for Affiliate Marketing

### Project Overview

Shortify is a comprehensive web application that automates the creation, customization, and publishing of YouTube Shorts for affiliate marketing. The platform transforms Temu product URLs (and eventually other platforms) into engaging short-form videos through a highly modular, scalable, and AI-enhanced pipeline. The goal is to empower affiliate marketers with minimal effort while providing advanced customization, real-time analytics, and cross-platform expansion capabilities.

### System Architecture

#### Frontend Technologies

- **Framework & Language:** React 18.2.0 with TypeScript  
- **Build Tool:** Vite  
- **Routing:** React Router DOM 6.22.0  
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS combined with shadcn/ui components  
- **Animations:** Framer Motion  
- **Data Management:** React Query for data fetching and caching  
- **Notifications:** Sonner for toast notifications  
- **State Management:** Context API with custom hooks (e.g., `useAuth`, `useProgress`, `useMobile`) with potential future migration to Redux Toolkit or Zustand for handling increased state complexity

#### Backend Infrastructure

- **Backend-as-a-Service:** Supabase (authentication, database, and edge functions)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for structured data storage
- **Media Processing & Storage:** Cloudinary for video rendering, processing, and storage
- **APIs:** YouTube API for direct video publishing and analytics; future integration with additional platforms (TikTok, Instagram Reels, etc.)
- **Microservices:** Consideration for segregating heavy tasks (video rendering, AI enhancements) into microservices for independent scalability and resilience
- **Edge Functions:** Custom Supabase Edge Functions for server-side operations like product extraction and AI-based product description enhancements

#### Architectural Considerations

- **Modularity & Scalability:**  
  - **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** Adopt DDD principles to manage business logic, especially as support for multiple affiliate platforms expands.  
  - **Microservices:** Isolate resource-intensive services to ensure the core system remains performant under increased load.
- **Security & Compliance:**  
  - Robust OAuth integrations, especially for YouTube and other future platforms.  
  - Data protection aligned with GDPR, CCPA, and other regional regulations.
- **Performance Optimization:**  
  - Use caching mechanisms for product extraction and AI operations.  
  - Introduce real-time performance monitoring and logging for both edge functions and media processing tasks.
